Course Overview:

This was a course reading on Cryptology.The science that designs crypto algorithms that provide data security in communication 
infrastructures and research the reliability of these algorithms is called "Cryptology". “Cryptology” is a science that is based 
on encryption and decryption, which is usually the expertise of mathematicians. For the science of cryptology, it can be said that
consist of the intersection of mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Cryptology science is a very broad 
science and is divided into 2 itself: "Cryptography" and "Cryptanalysis".

Part 1 - Cryptoanalysis

Time for course Completion:
2hrs 30mins

Purpose of the Course:
The purpose of the course was to give student detailed introduction to the world of Cryptology. The various branches of Cryptology 
and what each one does. Basic concept, historical ciphers, encryption, RNG's, Hashing, Encoding and finally, it's application.
Cryptanalysis is essential to the study of cybersecurity because Cryptanalysis plays a crucial role in evaluating the security
of cryptographic systems. In general, the more difficult it is to crack a cryptographic system using cryptanalysis, the more secure 
the system is.
What did you enjoy about the course?
The course was detailed and very condensed. Every concept was clearly and succinctly explained.

What did you find most challenging about the course?
Well, I took the test before reading through the course. I failed to answer correctly the questions from Random Number Generators,
and the latest web encryption protocol- TLS 1.3.
